# Keylogger Project

Welcome to the Keylogger Project by CriticalCyber. This project aims to provide a keylogger for educational purposes, demonstrating how keyloggers work and highlighting the importance of cybersecurity measures to protect against such threats.

## Introduction

A keylogger is a tool that records keystrokes made on a computer. This project is intended for educational purposes to raise awareness about the risks of keyloggers and to help users understand how they work. By studying this tool, users can learn to better protect themselves from malicious keyloggers.

## Disclaimer

**WARNING:** This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool to log keystrokes on a system without permission is illegal and unethical. Use this project responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records all keystrokes made on the system.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Open Source:** Source code is available for review and contributions.
